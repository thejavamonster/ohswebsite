Beginning with an investigation of themes from spacetime and theories about what exists, students explore ecological relations, historical approaches to doubt, introductory logical explanations, and fundamental questions about what we know (if anything!) and how we know what we know, before examining different views on how to live well as an individual and a member of a global community.",
