The class basically teaches you to have an open mind, but he has the opposite of an open mind, like he takes off points for not perfectly conforming to his vision of what a philosopher is. It is downright painful to try and make a logical argument during class, since he just bulldozes it down by totally ignoring it and forcing everyone to focus on what some dumb philosopher says. Like the whole point of hns is to learn how to think, but all dr rees teaches is how other philosophers think, there‚Äôs not much practice on thinking for yourself. Some parts of the class were inherently dumb, like the phrase ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù (humans are so fricking diverse) or the fact that you get points taken off reading questions if you add some of your opinion to it (you just have to word vomit the opinions and badly formed arguments of some philosopher from the reading) and my friend got points taken off for some really dumb reasons, like not fully articulating an obvious idea. From what I can see, the only way to get an A in this class with this teacher is to either 1. Be a really good writer or 2. Read the readings cover to cover and essentially just answer each question in the most boring, obvious way. He also doesn‚Äôt read the chat. Which is a problem, obviously.

Another really annoying aspect of his course is that he would ask us to participate in class and share our opinions about the reading but when we talked about our opinions he would criticize them so participation really went down at the end of the year. Also the reading questions due before class are super unhelpful since they are worth a decent portion of your grade and they are graded based on correctness. The problem is, they are done before class so there isn‚Äôt time to ask for help or let the material sink in. A decent amount of students were kinda stressed about the reading questions since some of the questions were cryptic and the readings were convoluted at times.

I found her teaching style engaging whilst not becoming overbearing either. She‚Äôs super nice and always really helpful if you come to her office hours. I would say, however, that the course itself is not necessarily the most immersive dive into critical theory or analytical literature, but as a STEM student, I found the connection between humans and our impact on nature a fun bridge between disciplines that kept me interested. Overall, I would say that I''m pretty satisfied with this course. I would note, however, that it can be difficult to get an A due to how essays are graded. Dr. Washburn is not the easiest grader, hence why I would highly encourage attending her office hours.', '2025-10-13T01:14:29.632Z'::timestamptz, 'published', 'jules328@ohs.stanford.edu', '787699a7501136c9f28b46cdd0ebe876', 0, 0) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

Going in, I expected Theory (with a capitalized T), and I ended up seeing a lot of critical commentary and (I‚Äôd say superficial) criticism. Regarding the difficulty of material, I find it simple; the approaches to the texts are far from rigorous close-reading, and are generally unsatisfactory in my perspective. The Theories are not hard to comprehend, and the short stories are just simple. Regarding Dr. Washburn, she is a good teacher (I do affirm this). However, the depth of content presented is inadequate for a high schooler who likes to think deeply about theory. (Personally, I disagree when I hear that a teacher prefers to have rhetorical questions as hooks in the introduction to analytical essays (instead of analytical precis to start the essay with).) Regarding the class discussion, I found them to be homogenous and unstimulating; my classmates are super nice people, but they seem to be reluctant to take intellectual risks in actually disagreeing with people (which I find frustrating, especially when all everyone is saying is something along the same lines). Yes, this course did try to escape and go beyond the oversimplifying narrative of ‚Äúnature is collapsing, we need to save it‚Äù, and I do commend its effort. However, such attempts are almost always shallow and superficial. I can summarize the entire course into 1 idea: previously we perceived 2 things (human and nature), now we integrate 2 into 1 and hope this saves Earth. And yes, I can keep elaborating about how this course collapses into environmental activism, but I choose to stop. I think if you are a person who doesn‚Äôt like English or Theory, then this course is for you (respect to you! you help the world to be a better place through means other than Theory and literature). The grading can be kind if you do what is conventional. And yes, I‚Äôd say that this course may be more suitable for students looking for an introductory-level engagement with material in English, or whose major focus in the future may not be humanities.', '2025-10-13T01:13:51.609Z'::timestamptz, 'published', 'jules328@ohs.stanford.edu', '787699a7501136c9f28b46cdd0ebe876', 0, 0) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
