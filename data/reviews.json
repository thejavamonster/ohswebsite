And please please please don‚Äôt be the kid who forgets to do the reading. I suggest taking notes for the reading AND opening the document before class.

Best thing I can recommend if you‚Äôre struggling with that is to go to office hours and talk with him and get clear on his expectations. Just try and get through it as best you can. I will say that I found it hard to express opinions or go about work the way it made sense for me. He‚Äôs very strict about writing his way, understanding things his way, and doing things his way.

The class basically teaches you to have an open mind, but he has the opposite of an open mind, like he takes off points for not perfectly conforming to his vision of what a philosopher is. It is downright painful to try and make a logical argument during class, since he just bulldozes it down by totally ignoring it and forcing everyone to focus on what some dumb philosopher says. Like the whole point of hns is to learn how to think, but all dr rees teaches is how other philosophers think, there‚Äôs not much practice on thinking for yourself. Some parts of the class were inherently dumb, like the phrase ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù (humans are so fricking diverse) or the fact that you get points taken off reading questions if you add some of your opinion to it (you just have to word vomit the opinions and badly formed arguments of some philosopher from the reading) and my friend got points taken off for some really dumb reasons, like not fully articulating an obvious idea. From what I can see, the only way to get an A in this class with this teacher is to either 1. Be a really good writer or 2. Read the readings cover to cover and essentially just answer each question in the most boring, obvious way. He also doesn‚Äôt read the chat. Which is a problem, obviously. Also don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúsolid‚Äù in assignments, he can‚Äôt seem to comprehend that it has multiple meanings other than a stage of matter.",

He gives a lot of feedback on assignments but 50% of it is ‚Äúelaborate on this.‚Äù He‚Äôs pretty helpful in office hours and responds to emails a lot but I usually went to office hours to figure out what he wanted me to write so most of the essays were really based on his conception of a ‚Äúgood paper‚Äù rather than an interesting thesis/content. Another really annoying aspect of his course is that he would ask us to participate in class and share our opinions about the reading but when we talked about our opinions he would criticize them so participation really went down at the end of the year. Also the reading questions due before class are super unhelpful since they are worth a decent portion of your grade and they are graded based on correctness. The problem is, they are done before class so there isn‚Äôt time to ask for help or let the material sink in. A decent amount of students were kinda stressed about the reading questions since some of the questions were cryptic and the readings were convoluted at times. I feel like the course causes more annoyance than stress but overall you are not missing out if you don‚Äôt take it. If you end up taking it I would recommend getting a different teacher to avoid boredom and annoyance. Might have been because I wasn‚Äôt really interested in what we were reading but the teacher didn‚Äôt help.",

The exams are open note so they wont ask simple definition questions and will require you to be well versed in the subject. But dont let that discourage you!!! Just make sure to always watch the lectures before class and if you are struggling with something then go to office hours. If you do this then you will be just fine. There were, at least this year, corrections for the exams that will give you up to half points back. Dr. Neemeh is a pretty fair and lenient grader on exams.

If someone had a question they made sure to let us know that OH was always open for us, or we could ask in class. I do not recommend emailing them because they take an eternity to respond, so PLEASE take into consideration the OH or in class questions seriously!

Science was qualitative, rather than quantitative for a while. But why did it change? How? Those are the kind of questions you ask yourself in this class. A lot of old readings though + will vary widely in length+amount of time needed to read.

Our class size was really small so there was sometimes not a lot of participation but in a larger class I‚Äôm sure there would be more. As a teacher, Dr. Bischof is super nice and as said above, extremely lenient with extensions (no limit on extensions, as long as you ask about 24ish hours in advance, she‚Äôll give you one without needing justification). She always gives super detailed feedback on papers, explaining exactly which parts were good and what you could add to make it better for next time. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say she‚Äôs a ‚Äúlenient‚Äù grader but definitely super fair and if you go to her Office Hours your essay grade will literally increase by like 5-10%. Also pro tip: for the expert sessions, assume no one has done the reading and ask questions that are good but can still be answered without reading the text. I feel like that usually generates more participation from the class. And one last thing, make sure to email her the expert session slides 24 hrs in advance.

She also cold calls, so definitely pay attention in class or talk at the beginning bc she usually never cold calls you if you‚Äôve spoken once or twice. Also, she basically reads everything in class with everyone (we each were one character when reading Hamlet for example, best part of the class), so just skim the readings. But read them for the first few weeks because she doesn‚Äôt always do that in the fall semester. She‚Äôs a harsh grader, on the homework assignments I usually got 8.5/10, maybe 9/10 on a good week and 7/10 on a bad. She gave a lot of good feedback on all the homework and the bigger assignments. On the bigger papers I got a few B+ and some B‚Äôs. I probably spent about 4-5 hrs a week (not including class time) on this class at the beginning (like when I did all the readings and stuff) but once I figured out how much she reviews the text in class I was only spending like 3-4hrs. I had a really bad experience in office hours personally (I couldn‚Äôt hear her, she couldn‚Äôt hear me, I came very late (time zone problems) and she had accidently left the AC room open, anyway big mess) and I never went again but I think I should have bc it would have been really useful for me I think, so don‚Äôt make the same mistake as me and go to office hours at the right time!

Coming from a Chinese school, Mrs. Stanford was pretty approachable in comparison (she didn‚Äôt take off points for a late submission early in the school year and her classes were fun! She does cold call in class, but pay attention and you‚Äôll be fine. She was very understanding towards my frequent internet difficulties as well)üòÇ. My English writing skills dramatically improved at the end of the school year (some in the Chinese OHS circle say that JE001 makes you good enough for college, and I think there is some truth to that), so I‚Äôd say it's a win. Overall just prepare for some low scores in the beginning and don‚Äôt panic when you do, note down what went wrong and try again next time. Middle school English is definitely going to be different from elementary school so don‚Äôt take it personally. Other than that, visit the writing center often and make it a habit, especially for those of you (like me) who have a hard time getting to office hours due to time zones and b&m school. (I attended office hours once throughout the entire school year at her request. She pointed out my problems very directly so be prepared, just remember that what doesn‚Äôt break you makes you stronger emotionally) TLDR: Grading is harsh but gets better when you get used to the system.

Mrs. Stanford is very passionate about the material she teaches, but she‚Äôs often very focused on her own ideas and snaps at anyone who has different thoughts. She makes a big point about textual evidence in class even when discussing the wider ideas and meaning behind Shakesphere‚Äôs writing, even when we‚Äôre diving into the realm of ‚Äúwell maybe shakespeare meant this‚Äù she‚Äôll only agree with the ideas without textual evidence IF she likes them. My second point ( this is going to be a better essay than I‚Äôve ever written in class for some reason /(h)j ) is her tech issues. Not her own tech issues, mind you. Tech issues should never be something to be angry at someone, and Mrs. Stanford has a lot of them, which is not the problem. The problem is that Mrs. Stanford literally attacks kids who have internet issues, giving them lower participation grades and just treating them unfairly, when she herself spends a good twenty minutes out of some classes out of the room. Now, to quote her many times, ‚ÄúPlease fix this before you come to class with tech support‚Äù (Stanford, 167). I‚Äôm sorry but a lot of people don‚Äôt have fast internet and they can‚Äôt fix it, and even if they could you can‚Äôt predict tech issues before they happen. Next on my long list of issues with this class is the grading. Not only is she crazy biased in her grading, but it takes so long. I understand that she‚Äôs busy and she has other matters to attend to, but it's seriously hard to have a single day to correct my draft and address all her feedback. Once I had to literally rewrite a paper because of how much she wanted me to change. I understand that my paper needs correcting, but I can‚Äôt do my best work in a day.

      "text": "(Dr. Morphew) He‚Äôs a very lenient grader for small assignments (I almost always got 10/10s on them), but he does not give much feedback on them. I don‚Äôt think he set up a good ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù(?) in class, so everyone was very reluctant to participate (most of the time, around half of the class didn‚Äôt participate). He grades harsher for writing assessments and gives more feedback on them compared to the small weekly assignments. He‚Äôs very chill(?) (I don‚Äôt know what the exact word I wanna use is, sorry) in class. He kind of discouraged me from participating (I will not get into the details because they are VERY petty (my details, I mean)), but everyone else seemed to have an alr experience.",

      "text": "(Dr. KLAH) Dr. KLAH is a W. I loved her class. This is a wonderful course if you want to improve upon your writing skills and understanding of complex classic texts. Discussion sections are always lively and often take us to very interesting places. Dr. KLAH‚Äôs affinity for the little details (multiple definitions of words, rhyme scheme, etc.) make for some hilarious and productive conversations. (You can tell Dr. KLAH really loves literature because of the way she approaches the readings). The prompts she uses at the start of class are always unique and help me understand the text better. She encourages many different interpretations, especially in the weekly writing practices. In my opinion, the writing practices are super helpful to build up the skills (textual analysis, how to write a paragraph, how to make a good claim, etc.) that will be expected on the WAs. It's relatively easy to get good grades on the homework, as long as you try to come up with something insightful/interesting to write about. She‚Äôs definitely a tougher grader on WAs (I consistently got high 80s), but offers a lot of quality feedback. However, getting a good participation score is easy as long as you contribute on mic once or twice per class and volunteer to read slides. As far as grading speed goes, she is definitely slow (in my experience, it takes about 2 weeks to get homework back and about 3-4 weeks to get a WA back), but the comments are worth it. Every one of her suggestions is specific and relevant. In my opinion, Dr. KLAH is really awesome about offering support outside of class. She always lets us know when the WTC is hosting a helpful event, encourages us to attend office hours, and answers emails super fast. I would definitely recommend using the course lab/office hours for big assignments (like the WAs), it helps a lot. Overall this class is a blast and Dr. KLAH is a wonderful teacher. 10/10, would recommend to all literature nerd middle schoolers.",

      "text": "(Dr. Hendrickson) I really enjoyed this class! Dr. Hendrickson made it engaging and as mentioned above the discussions were really fun. Always gave 10/10 on weekly homeworks, (didn‚Äôt give any feedback on the weekly homeworks at all though) as long as you did the minimum required work, basically just writing a paragraph that answers the prompt. I personally got an average of 89 on the bigger papers (he gave good feedback on these). Each week you have to do two readings (one for each class), usually ~5 pages, not that long, and one (or at the end of the spring semester) two paragraphs for a homework assignment. I spent about 3-4 hrs total in the week (on a week without a big paper due) in this class so it was very manageable (in my opinion). Dr. Hendrickson always had time for ‚ÄúBurning Questions‚Äù so make sure to note down all your questions. Favorite part of class was probably the literary warm-ups and maybe the 30sec stretch breaks. Overall, a great class, highly recommended!",

And the workshop is super helpful, you get your writing revised by your classmates & it‚Äôs always fun. It‚Äôs extremely easy to get more than 96% in this class. Dr. Morphew is very chill and gives great advice.

Coming from someone who has been full-time at OHS since 7th grade, I absolutely love Dr. Wiebracht, so much so that this coming year I‚Äôm taking his critical theory class. He truly enjoys what he is teaching and wants all of his students to share in that joy as well. He is super duper helpful in office hours, though they do book out pretty quickly so I would book in advance to make sure you get a slot. He grades homework basically on completion, but I highly recommend putting effort into them, as often times you can end up using a homework response in a later essay. 10/10 course, possibly my favorite english course I‚Äôve had, and just really learn as much as you can from it, don‚Äôt be intimidated, he is there to help you and help you work through your ideas on whatever you‚Äôre reading. He also grades about average (2 weeksish) and gives absolutely excellent feedback on papers, so really try to apply his feedback to the next essay.",

Dr. W is also never strict about sticking to the prompt with essays. He encourages you to take your own route on whatever interests you and to only use the prompt as inspiration. He actually says if you have a better idea then any of the prompts just run it by him and he‚Äôll probably approve! I learned SO MUCH in this course. There‚Äôs one weekly assignment that‚Äôs a page long, but you can basically say whatever you want about the reading in a page long tangent as grading is only hard on essays, hw is based on completion and showing interest, just expand on whatever interested you or caught your attention in the reading and a page is super easy.",

He always said we should go into breakouts so we can talk (best part of the class) but instead we just go down the line of hands and half the class doesnt get to talk. Also he grades on a letter scale, so even if your homework assignment was perfect, its just a 96 instead of the normal 100 which brings down your final grade a bit (and you might need those points later on).

      "text": "(Dr. Washburn) [2024-2025] (Take this comment as a grain of salt, it represents only my opinion, which is highly biased) I was disappointed by this course. Going in, I expected Theory (with a capitalized T), and I ended up seeing a lot of critical commentary and (I‚Äôd say superficial) criticism. Regarding the difficulty of material, I find it simple; the approaches to the texts are far from rigorous close-reading, and are generally unsatisfactory in my perspective. The Theories are not hard to comprehend, and the short stories are just simple. Regarding Dr. Washburn, she is a good teacher (I do affirm this). However, the depth of content presented is inadequate for a high schooler who likes to think deeply about theory. (Personally, I disagree when I hear that a teacher prefers to have rhetorical questions as hooks in the introduction to analytical essays (instead of analytical precis to start the essay with).) Regarding the class discussion, I found them to be homogenous and unstimulating; my classmates are super nice people, but they seem to be reluctant to take intellectual risks in actually disagreeing with people (which I find frustrating, especially when all everyone is saying is something along the same lines). Yes, this course did try to escape and go beyond the oversimplifying narrative of ‚Äúnature is collapsing, we need to save it‚Äù, and I do commend its effort. However, such attempts are almost always shallow and superficial. I can summarize the entire course into 1 idea: previously we perceived 2 things (human and nature), now we integrate 2 into 1 and hope this saves Earth. And yes, I can keep elaborating about how this course collapses into environmental activism, but I choose to stop. I think if you are a person who doesn‚Äôt like English or Theory, then this course is for you (respect to you! you help the world to be a better place through means other than Theory and literature). The grading can be kind if you do what is conventional. And yes, I‚Äôd say that this course may be more suitable for students looking for an introductory-level engagement with material in English, or whose major focus in the future may not be humanities.",

Overall the structure of the course is similar to MWA, but I know he mentioned he‚Äôs planning on changing things for the ‚Äò25-26 school year so there might be some surprises. Would def recommend him and this class, going to his OH are also really helpful (and he‚Äôs also super chill if you just want to talk about random stuff)!",

She was one of the most enthusiastic OHS teachers I‚Äôve ever met, and just generally cares about her students (though there are some times where the conversations go way off topic). Dr. dawkins came back for the latter half of the spring semester and its been great so far. You also have the option to do creative projects, which is nice and helps your grade go up.

While it was often hard to get the readings done (often like ‚Ä¶ 50+ pages sobbing emoji) it was well worth it for the class discussions. Because this level is non-required english, the people participating in class are people who *actually want to participate in class* so what basically everyone has to say is really really interesting. Big difference to MWA last year . lol . Note that Hruska is super lenient with extensions but only if you ask more than 24 hours in ahead! Otherwise she is not lenient. Kinda annoying but fine whatever. If you *can* take as a junior concurrently with DFRL, do it. Especially in the second semester there is a lot of concept overlap, because this class is very heavily historical/political.

She keeps a very consistent order in class, usually just going down the list of people alphabetically, so you know exactly when you‚Äôre going to do something on the whiteboard, which is a life-saver. She also is by FAR the fastest grader I‚Äôve ever had; one time I remember taking one of the unit exams (that you could take at home parent-proctored), then going out to dinner, and literally right when I got there (~10 minutes after I submitted), it came back fully graded, like marks/feedback and everything! As for the course, there can be a lot of work, but since it is so consistent week after week, it is easy to start maintaining a work schedule. I‚Äôd recommend starting the problem sets as soon as the second class (wed/thur) ends, because it can catch up. In terms of material, it‚Äôs a 7/10 math class, but Revathi takes it up to a 10/10.",

Overall, a great teacher and really loves what he does. One thing I suggest, would be to watch the video lectures on topics you are struggling with and read the textbook if you don‚Äôt like to participate or ask questions. Otherwise, he makes time to meet with you and usually replies to email within 20 minutes. Also, he makes it more than just like learning the content. He is really passionate and does everything so that you can learn more than just the ‚Äúbaseline curriculum‚Äù. For example, he made a book club on how to study. Also, the first semester isn‚Äôt super difficult, just stay consistent. So, 10/10 class.",

      "text": "(Dr. Kalubowila) [2023-2024] She was my favorite teacher this year by far (possibly ever)!! She explained the material very thoroughly and I never once felt lost in her class. She doesnt expect you to be well versed in the material before class and will teach everything in a way that is super easy to understand. This was so awesome for me as I feel like I dont fully grasp math concepts purely from a textbook so having her explain it all in class really cemented my understanding of the subjects. She is also so so so nice!! I love talking with her and ive gone to office hours many times to ask for study tips and help on questions. She prepares you very well for all the exams and will give you some idea what to expect on them. As long as you pay attention in class and go to office hours when needed then finishing with an A in the class is easy. She is also an easy grader and as long as it is shown that you know the material she wont take off many points (if any at all) for minor errors. Dr. Kalubowila also gives super helpful feedback on exams and will explain why you got points docked (she also welcomes you to come to office hours if you need further explanations on the question or the feedback)! Something that has helped me immensely in this course is going back to scroll through past classes (looking at the recordings) and taking notes based off of those. Overall I absolutely adored having her as my teacher and she made the class fun and easy to understand!! :)",

He basically assumes everyone already knows how to do everything and will ask advanced questions, expecting people to know the answer (and will then thoroughly express his disappointment when there‚Äôs dead silence in the chat). If you‚Äôre good at math, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about having Dr. Van Lingen, just make sure to participate A LOT bc he‚Äôs pretty strict about participation grades (you need to be typing answers in chat 24/7, even if it‚Äôs the wrong answer). If you‚Äôre not good at math, though, I‚Äôd recommend trying to switch sections to get another teacher. Dr. Van Lingen will just expect you to know everything and will get grumpy when you don‚Äôt and will also complain about how people don‚Äôt participate enough (he def has a grumpy/disappointed/ borderline angry old man vibe to him). Also, his feedback on exams is terrible. The only feedback he gives is either ‚ÄúGreat!,‚Äù ‚ÄúOk‚Äù or ‚ÄúOff‚Äù but never actually explains what you did wrong or gives any detail besides that. So basically, if you don‚Äôt understand what you did wrong on an exam you‚Äôre forced to either go to Office Hours and ask him or just figure it out for yourself.",

As for the class itself, it really pretty chill grade-wise, but there is quite a bit of homework. I think I spent probably ~3 hours per each homework (some I‚Äôve spent much longer), but I know some people who average much shorter than that, it really just depends. The finals/midterms are open notes, and ngl I found them kinda fun.",

      "text": "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! This is the absolute WORST class I have ever taken. I have never been so angry with a class and teacher before. D‚ÄôUrso is not a good teacher at all. I don‚Äôt know how people say she‚Äôs a good teacher, she‚Äôs not. She is so disorganized, monotone, and never seems like she wants to be there or teach. In parent teacher conferences she said to my parent that what you learn in class is not relevant to what you read or do for homework. So what‚Äôs the point of class? Good question. For her to just ramble on about something that you‚Äôll never hear about again or ever use. She never explains or teaches anything relevant. You do one long research project/paper at the end of the spring semester, and she never went over it in class or explained what she wanted. She literally skipped over the slides that explained it. Her feedback or solution is always ‚Äúsee her in office hours,‚Äù which is never helpful. I think she just genuinely doesn‚Äôt know what to do. She seems very clueless. I‚Äôm sure she knows the material, but she cannot teach it for the life of her. This class has been nothing but frustrating, and I can‚Äôt believe a school as prestigious as OHS (a STEM school) has a math class THIS BAD. People write off bad teaching as their ‚Äúteaching style,‚Äù and we as a society really need to stop doing that to spare their feelings and say it like it is: bad teaching. D‚ÄôUrso is a bad teacher. She does not teach. If you need a math class, just take something else‚Ä¶ without D‚ÄôUrso as a teacher.",

Idk she was also just annoying in some other ways too (like for example didn‚Äôt actually know the answers to the breakout room questions and told us how we were doing based on cross checking with the other rooms ‚Äì sure fine but then you have to wait until the other rooms are done and if all rooms get it wrong then you‚Äôre screwed) Also note that the second semester of this class is Stanford‚Äôs Math51, which is 90% linear algebra and not mvc lol. At least last year idk if they‚Äôre changing it again",

Based on what I had heard from fellow students, they mostly said complex analysis was easier; I had the opposite experience. I wouldn‚Äôt say this course is drastically harder than any of the other higher level math courses (except maybe discrete math and geometry of numbers). Real analysis was much more intuitive given our calculus background. Complex analysis is more powerful but also more difficult, and it felt like it had more concepts. Presentations were easy 100s.

The class is relatively difficult, and I suggest you take lots of notes and for Eutropius days, to come to class prepared with a preliminary translation. He will call on students either in order of last name or randomly so you need to pay attention in this class and work on your memorization. The exams are proctored, but he tells you basically what is on them ahead of time, making the studying process much easier. The take-home tests allow you access to the book for a short time, take full advantage of that opportunity. Overall an amazing if not slightly stressful course!",

Pisarello is super super nice though and very lenient with extensions, so if you ever need more time for an exam, I guarantee you she‚Äôll give it to you. She is also super helpful if you don‚Äôt understand a translation ‚Äì pls don‚Äôt worry about messing a translation up bc Magistra is super nice about it, very chill, always willing to help, and will never shame/make fun of a student for getting a translation wrong. Overall, like the person above said, this class was basically just a book club. It was super fun and entertaining, and 90% of class time was spent just reading Cicero, Ovid, or Catullus and either admiring or shitting on their writing. 10/10 class and 10/10 teacher.

      "text": "(Magistra Pisarello) Just so you know, I might be a little biased since I really like Latin. This course is amazing. It‚Äôs such a nice payoff after Latin 2. The reading will feel difficult at first, but it gets a lot easier as you go along, not because the readings get easier, but because you will get a lot better. The readings in the second half of the second semester can get pretty long, but Magistra has absolutely no problem with you not finishing them. She acknowledged that some people (or most people) will only have time to reach a certain point, and she will account for that. There is no punishment for it. If the class as a group doesn‚Äôt get through all the reading, there will not be questions about it on exams except for maybe questions about the content (we were given English translations of the parts we didn‚Äôt get to as a class). The readings are really fun though. The fall semester is focused on Cicero‚Äôs oratory, and we looked at some of the letters he wrote (which was really fun, and I found some of them really funny, especially coming from Cicero). The fall semester is about poetry (Catullus on Ovid), which I also really enjoyed. The course also covers some rhetorical devices and how literature is structured on a broad level (this can be applied to any text, not only Latin). I‚Äôll say it again, though, this course is so good. I think this is the most fun course I‚Äôve taken at OHS, and graduating from OHS without talking to Magistra at least once feels like it should be a crime (i.e., she‚Äôs really nice and generally a great person). Class discussion often felt like a book/poetry club, and Magistra called it ‚ÄúLatin and vibes‚Äù at one point. Carthago delenda est.",

I would study/practice Spanish for 30-60 minutes everyday after/before class. You are expected to participate multiple times during class, although we do breakout rooms at least once a class.

Classes are fun with not that much reading required before hand but I will say she started using chatgpt for lesson slides and activities so they can get a little weird but you get a lot of time in breakout rooms basically just talking about your interests and opinions so you can make some good friends especially since class sizes are generally small. Also just so you know she uses a function on AC which allows her to see which students are on different browsers/tabs and she will dick participation points if she sees you leaving the AC tab at all. Other than that praticiaption is pretty chill, its a great environment and I dont think anyone felt embarrassed or hesitant to speak on mic and make mistakes. Grading is pretty chill? Idk in the second semester she switched formats were you got an second attempt on quizzes but instead of an easy final project you had a 2 hour final exam on proctorio. I think before the change the class was pretty low stress as long as you were prepared for the quizzes since she graded the projects fairly easily but in the last semester the stress from the quizzes was reduced by a lot and they were basically free As but the Final was really stressful. She ended up grading on a curve and it was ok but idk how she‚Äôs organizing the course this year. Overall though, this is such a good class, you have alot of fun in class and you learn a lot and improve your writing, speaking and understanding so much.",

If you can learn from a textbook, get one. It will tremendously help with your understanding of concepts. Every week there are modules to go through (reading and or lecture, some additional suggested videos, reading questions, usually a lab with writeup (sometimes no writeup) and photodocumentation and PLQs (post lab questions). NFFRs (Notes for Future Research) are graded pretty hard, so think of good ones! Then there is a practice quiz and quiz (the questions are written very strangely and are very confusing, there are multiple choice questions and select all questions). In class, I had Dr. Doherty. He is so nice and encouraging; he teaches some but not very much. Usually labs and other assignments are not graded right away, but grading is PRETTY quick. Dr. Doherty makes sure to give personal feedback on all assignments. He is very encouraging! If science is your strong suit, it‚Äôs not too hard of a class (besides the quizzes). There are not 4 quizzes per week, only one, but it is kind of disorganized during class. It‚Äôs neither disorganized or organized, and it depends on how you learn best. You should probably take this class as it has fundamental and fun topics, just don‚Äôt stress too much! (Oh and midterms and finals have short answer questions!) (Musical mystery guest has no point, I guess it‚Äôs just fun? Blookets are good as they review material.) So overall, it‚Äôs a course that has fun topics but isn‚Äôt the best in terms of organization and grading. But you should take it (because I found it fun!) However, sometimes material that has not been covered yet is on quizzes and other assessments. (Just a note, for the bio section, you have to learn about phototropism and Joseph Priestley‚Äôs experiments on your own!)",

The pace of the class was pretty good and the workload was not super hard. A lot of people also warned me about the big quizzes, midtermis, and final exams. However, they were not too bad. A study tip that you NEED to know if you want to get a good score on these exams is to PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE using the problems from the textbook. Do ALL of the cumulative questions because all of the questions on the exams are basically carbon copies of those. GO INTO OFFICE HOURS. Dr. Katsir is SUPER helpful when you need it.

      "text": "(Mrs. Birge-Liberman) I don‚Äôt have much to add about the points above, but they are all definitely true and I have had similar experiences. What‚Äôs interesting about her is that she tries to care sort of? Like on one of the early fall assignments I said I spent about 17 hours on the assignment (it was a requirement to fill out a coversheet that included that question) and she brought it up at PT conferences and was like ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm really worried about [My name] because she spent 17 hours on this assignment‚Äù and then proceeded to bash my sleep schedule because ‚ÄúWell my kids go to sleep at 10 pm every day.‚Äù Ok? I work best after 10 pm. Maybe that‚Äôs not the case for your kids, but it is for me. It‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôre different people. And then after I went to her in office hours for help on my final project (she didn‚Äôt really provide help and even said she feels like she‚Äôs being unhelpful) she told my counselor that she should reach out to me because ‚ÄúI seemed stressed about the assignment‚Äù. The counselor was nice, but I also have pretty bad social anxiety, which she knows, because I quite literally had a panic attack when giving my spring presentation, so I‚Äôm not sure why she thought an awkward meeting with someone I don‚Äôt know was going to help? That just added to my stress and rendered me incapable of doing much of anything that day. And she does all of this being ‚Äúconcerned and caring,‚Äù but then doesn‚Äôt actually do anything to help. She doesn‚Äôt work with me to see if there‚Äôs something I could do to be more efficient, or, god forbid, actually state in the rubric what she‚Äôs grading the assignment on so that I don‚Äôt stress so much about not knowing what‚Äôs on her ‚Äúinvisible rubric‚Äù. And then when I go see her in OHs about something she took points off of, she either acts like she‚Äôs the victim (she manipulates the words I‚Äôm saying to act like I‚Äôm a toddler (or maybe a sixth grader considering that‚Äôs who she used to teach) pitching a fit). I‚Äôll be like ‚Äúhey, maybe I missed something. Do you think maybe in the future it could be changed to be explicit so that next year‚Äôs students don‚Äôt have the same problem?‚Äù or ask her where it said to do something, she‚Äôll just say that I ‚Äúshould know [how to interpret the incredibly misleading instructions to fit her ‚Äúinvisible rubric‚Äù] by this point,‚Äù when it‚Äôs literally never been discussed. Anyways, TLDR: She‚Äôs very two-sided/hypocritical, and I genuinely learned more from other students in the class than I did from her (and she constantly acted like that was a good thing). Also this class legitimately took about as much, if not slightly more time & energy than all my other classes (full -time OHS, w/ multiple AP-level classes) combined, I think a lot of that could have been avoided, but Mrs. B was the opposite of helpful with that. She doesn‚Äôt know how to use class time effectively. She‚Äôs not necessarily a bad teacher for all schools, but really doesn‚Äôt seem to be a great fit for OHS.",

As someone who has taken twelve college courses and been full-time at OHS for three years, during which I‚Äôve taken a wide array of science courses both from and outside the school, I cannot stress enough how terribly this class was taught‚Äîone of the worst experiences of my academic career has been dealing with Mrs. Birge-Liberman. I had to send her EIGHT EMAILS over the course of TWO MONTHS just to get my midterm grade from the FALL SEMESTER ‚Äúfixed,‚Äù and it still isn‚Äôt in Powerschool to this day, by the way. After bringing it up to her, she told me that I submitted my corrections late EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE IN BEFORE DUE. In fact, I know of at least three other students who submitted the assignments AFTER I TURNED IT IN and still got full credit. This isn‚Äôt the first instance of favortism that I‚Äôve seen from her. In addition, she‚Äôll dock points for the most absurd reasons. Your graph is too small? MINUS TEN PERCENT. Forgot Works Cited? MINUS TEN PERCENT. You didn‚Äôt include something that the prompt didn‚Äôt even ask you for? MINUS FIFTEEN PERCENT. You could answer a question flawlessly and with adequate scrutiny, sophistication, and substantive knowledge but still be docked points for not providing real-world examples even though you were never asked to include any. Just because she felt like adding her own invisible rubric. At this point, I imagine most readers would question if what I just mentioned was a report or a satire. No, that was not satire and it was not exaggeration, to my dismay. You WILL  lose points on assignments if they‚Äôre not exactly to her liking (which she doesn‚Äôt tell you until after she grades it, by the way‚Äîhow fun and intellectually stimulating! uh, no, wtf). What‚Äôs truly unfortunate is that Dr. Vetter (whom I‚Äôve heard great things about) is no longer teaching this course‚Äîone for which I was extremely excited for, as a future biomedical engineering major‚Äîmeaning that we‚Äôre now stuck with an AC-incompetent, condescending teacher who seems to have a liking for just bombing your GPA. Throughout almost every class, she treats us all as though we‚Äôre senseless elementary-school children. Maybe it‚Äôs because her past teaching experience was with sixth-graders‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not sixth graders. Her  demeanor often comes across as condescending and disrespectful of our efforts. Furthermore, if you have any sort of question, she‚Äôll almost always redirect you to her inflexible office hours instead of answering something that would not take more than a minute. Like, excuse me? If it was an OH question, I would ask it in OH. Think ‚ÄúIf I expected you to text back a week later, I would have sent you a pigeon.‚Äù Mrs. Birge-Liberman DOES NOT BELONG IN A HIGH SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT and she certainly does not belong at an institution like Stanford Online High School.",

      "text": "(Mr. Mostarshed) Good Class. ^ For the above comment, the first semester had a lot of breakouts, however so far in the second semester there hasn't been a single session and it's mostly him teaching, so I believe he's learned from feedback. He's the goat, he's a little sleepy in class but much more helpful in office hours. Grades very nicely, doesn‚Äôt even give a late penalty most of the time. Bit of a slow grader, but when he does grade its usually 100% as long as you did all the steps. For the class itself, the textbook is relatively boring and we cover  SO much material, but if you study a lot for the exams its manageable. Good course, very interesting.",

I know she gets a lot of hate and I‚Äôll admit shes not the best at actually teaching but she lets you do corrections on literally every assignment other than the midterm and final which makes this class so much easier. You can literally go into exams with a 100 because as long as you submit corrections you will have a 100 regardless of how poorly you did on your first attempt or how clueless you are at physics. And tbh we had mostarshed for a bunch of classes as a sub and he was sooo boring and monotone and just reading straight off the slides i dont get why people prefer him over hamaoui. She does cold call in class but she never expects you to know the answer and will never get mad at you or be disappointed if you get something wrong even if its really obvious and she really only cold calls on people who are very obviously not paying attention (visibly talking to someone else on camera, constantly not looking at the screen/being on your phone, or very clearly on another tab/watching videos or movies/playing video games). Also the Pearson assignments and unit reviews are technically not optional but theyre not graded so you do not have to do them or submit your work and you wont get penalized. Also the unit tests are unproctored and have a very very long time limit (I literally took a nap and attended a club meeting while taking one exam) and also arent worth that much in terms of your grade so if you get something wrong you can do corrections but sometimes its just not worth the ffort cause its worth so little.",

Having Dr. Oas meant having a teacher who covered all the relevant material needed for the exams. This is especially important because there is no set reading material and you learn from recorded lectures and in-class lectures. Exams are worth like 80%, which is not fun.

Vetter is not a hard grader by any means and the class is refreshing from that standpoint after AP Bio. The course can get a bit dry imo but as long as you do the readings, engage in class, and do your work on time, it‚Äôs very easy to get an A (and honestly a 100 if you try!)",

      "text": "Extremely rewarding course with excellent instructor. If you took Modern Physics, you must take this course! It will not be stressful. Make sure you have the time set aside for a standard intensive OHS course, but nothing beyond that. You will definitely understand your interests in physics (or disinterest), and will leave the course as a better thinker and with a community you will be able to talk to in the future! Everyone in the class is very diligent and kind, and the instructor is as well, so it forms a nice environment to learn topics you typically don‚Äôt reach until the third or fourth year in undergrad. Just put effort‚Äînotes during class, reviewing slides after class, or similar‚Äîand you will be fine. You will get to do a self-guided project both semesters to explore whatever you like, and you get to formalize it into a paper as well. Very nice addition to your portfolio. Grading -- do not worry, he understands college applications and, if you‚Äôre putting effort, he will work with you. Put in the effort, get the A. Just make sure you do not miss class -- these are the lectures! Also do not slack off, this class builds up, and will become hard if you do not ask questions as they come. Ask questions after class and in OH -- help is there if you want it, but you need to want it. I highly recommend this course to anyone considering a path in CS, Physics, or even other fields. It gives a depthful exposure to allow you to comprehend current literature in a way that allows you to say something intelligent.",

      "text": "Mrs. Rathi [2024-25] First month and I hate her already. Here are some basic conditions of being a good teacher that she violates:\nDo something with class time. Class meetings aren‚Äôt emails, lectures or an assignment, it‚Äôs an interactive time. Figure out something to do with it. Don‚Äôt lecture in a dull monotone if you want people to pay attention.\nDon‚Äôt make assumptions. Not everyone who is smiling is distracted. If you KNOW that your class doesn‚Äôt make people smile, do something about it rather than snap at all the smiling people.\nYou know more than they do. If all of your students are getting the wrong answer, the same wrong answer, that might just mean that they don‚Äôt have an intuitive sense of how computers work. It does not necessarily mean they didn‚Äôt do the reading and need to be shamed on record for it. Also, they can‚Äôt do something as fast as you can just because they understand it conceptually. \nBe respectful. Your students will not learn a thing from a teacher who doesn‚Äôt respect them. Questions are ok and should be encouraged, even if you think you already answered them, because perhaps the student doesn‚Äôt understand your answer. Don‚Äôt, ever, at any point, for any reason, shout at your students calling them CHILD in command tense.\nBe understanding. Sometimes life happens to your students. Don‚Äôt keep bugging the person whose mic/camera isn‚Äôt working, they usually can‚Äôt do anything about it until class is out. And please, if you must cold call, don‚Äôt for the love of God cold call THE CRYING KID. Saying ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre crying i‚Äôll pick someone else now‚Äù does NOT fix the mistake you just made.\nBe interesting. Students do not pay attention to/remember/care about a boring or hostile meeting. You will not be able to teach anything if you don‚Äôt utilize these, and you will DEFINITELY not be liked.",

We had Polacco for a sub for one day, and I am so hyped to have him next year instead. She is super vague and if you ask her to repeat more than once she gets a bit annoyed, ‚ÄúI just told you,‚Äù once a good old, ‚Äúwhy dont you get it?‚Äù, or she just says the same exact thing she did before even if you said I dont understand. She changed the participation requirement halfway through the course, promised extra credit for whoever was on mic the most but did not give it (Said she forgot about it next semester) TO HER CREDIT, whenever I went to office hours her attitude was so different and she was super helpful, and even showed me samples of how something was supposed to be done instead which is amazing. Dont expect that vibe in class though‚Ä¶ its like two different teachers\t! you don't do the assignment the way she wanted (which she won‚Äôt necessarily tell you how she does, or the assignment says to do it one way, and she wants it differently you get points off) she takes off 2 points (which for my year you could NOT redo it, it has to be less than an 8, so 7 and below that you can redo, and she would give 8‚Äôs).

The above comments are not wrong, but he explains in class very thoroughly with analogies, so if you ask in those moments and with those contexts he will better be able to help than random questions (unless there‚Äôs a guiding HW problem).
