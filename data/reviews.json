Best thing I can recommend if you‚Äôre struggling with that is to go to office hours and talk with him and get clear on his expectations. Just try and get through it as best you can. I will say that I found it hard to express opinions or go about work the way it made sense for me. He‚Äôs very strict about writing his way, understanding things his way, and doing things his way.

The class basically teaches you to have an open mind, but he has the opposite of an open mind, like he takes off points for not perfectly conforming to his vision of what a philosopher is. It is downright painful to try and make a logical argument during class, since he just bulldozes it down by totally ignoring it and forcing everyone to focus on what some dumb philosopher says. Like the whole point of hns is to learn how to think, but all dr rees teaches is how other philosophers think, there‚Äôs not much practice on thinking for yourself. Some parts of the class were inherently dumb, like the phrase ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù (humans are so fricking diverse) or the fact that you get points taken off reading questions if you add some of your opinion to it (you just have to word vomit the opinions and badly formed arguments of some philosopher from the reading) and my friend got points taken off for some really dumb reasons, like not fully articulating an obvious idea. From what I can see, the only way to get an A in this class with this teacher is to either 1. Be a really good writer or 2. Read the readings cover to cover and essentially just answer each question in the most boring, obvious way. He also doesn‚Äôt read the chat. Which is a problem, obviously. Also don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúsolid‚Äù in assignments, he can‚Äôt seem to comprehend that it has multiple meanings other than a stage of matter.",

Another really annoying aspect of his course is that he would ask us to participate in class and share our opinions about the reading but when we talked about our opinions he would criticize them so participation really went down at the end of the year. Also the reading questions due before class are super unhelpful since they are worth a decent portion of your grade and they are graded based on correctness. The problem is, they are done before class so there isn‚Äôt time to ask for help or let the material sink in. A decent amount of students were kinda stressed about the reading questions since some of the questions were cryptic and the readings were convoluted at times. I feel like the course causes more annoyance than stress but overall you are not missing out if you don‚Äôt take it. If you end up taking it I would recommend getting a different teacher to avoid boredom and annoyance.

He was helpful in office hours and lets you run ideas by him to let you know if you are on the right track. Also not a mean grader! As long as you put in the work and show an understanding of the material, its not hard to get an A (this is for things like the writing assignments). The exams in this class are a little challenging but as long as you understand the material you will be fine. The exams are open note so they wont ask simple definition questions and will require you to be well versed in the subject. But dont let that discourage you!!! Just make sure to always watch the lectures before class and if you are struggling with something then go to office hours. If you do this then you will be just fine. There were, at least this year, corrections for the exams that will give you up to half points back. Dr. Neemeh is a pretty fair and lenient grader on exams.

      "text": "I also agree that Neemeh is the best MSB instructor. They made sure the class was engaging and fun, and never made me feel stupid. Neemeh also had a thing with checking up with some students before class started, and idk I thought that was super helpful with making the environment less stressful. If someone had a question they made sure to let us know that OH was always open for us, or we could ask in class. I do not recommend emailing them because they take an eternity to respond, so PLEASE take into consideration the OH or in class questions seriously! But I definitely recommend Dr. Neemeh as a core instructor for those who were wondering :D",

      "text": "(Dr Neemeh) [2024-2025] Dr. Neemeh is an AMAZING teacher. They teach clearly, concisely and is super kind, so if you need any help on a quiz, an assignment, or even just to chat, Dr. Neemeh is there for you in office hours! I learnt so much in MSB and was amazed by how they explained things. A tip I have for this course is to write notes during class, as it is super helpful for the weekly quizzes. If you have any questions, ask Dr. Neemeh because you want to make sure that you understand each concept. The class environment is super chill and not stressful at all! Overall, amazing course, amazing teacher.",

He is quite a specific and harsh grader at times which can be difficult to cope with. Also if you are doing an assignment BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE. He isn‚Äôt really as bad as a teacher that everyone makes him seem to be, but if you are fragile about grades and don‚Äôt think you can handle learning from mistakes probably go for another section.
