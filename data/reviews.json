Best thing I can recommend if you‚Äôre struggling with that is to go to office hours and talk with him and get clear on his expectations. Just try and get through it as best you can. I will say that I found it hard to express opinions or go about work the way it made sense for me. He‚Äôs very strict about writing his way, understanding things his way, and doing things his way.

The class basically teaches you to have an open mind, but he has the opposite of an open mind, like he takes off points for not perfectly conforming to his vision of what a philosopher is. It is downright painful to try and make a logical argument during class, since he just bulldozes it down by totally ignoring it and forcing everyone to focus on what some dumb philosopher says. Like the whole point of hns is to learn how to think, but all dr rees teaches is how other philosophers think, there‚Äôs not much practice on thinking for yourself. Some parts of the class were inherently dumb, like the phrase ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù (humans are so fricking diverse) or the fact that you get points taken off reading questions if you add some of your opinion to it (you just have to word vomit the opinions and badly formed arguments of some philosopher from the reading) and my friend got points taken off for some really dumb reasons, like not fully articulating an obvious idea. From what I can see, the only way to get an A in this class with this teacher is to either 1. Be a really good writer or 2. Read the readings cover to cover and essentially just answer each question in the most boring, obvious way. He also doesn‚Äôt read the chat. Which is a problem, obviously. Also don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúsolid‚Äù in assignments, he can‚Äôt seem to comprehend that it has multiple meanings other than a stage of matter.",

He gives a lot of feedback on assignments but 50% of it is ‚Äúelaborate on this.‚Äù He‚Äôs pretty helpful in office hours and responds to emails a lot but I usually went to office hours to figure out what he wanted me to write so most of the essays were really based on his conception of a ‚Äúgood paper‚Äù rather than an interesting thesis/content. Another really annoying aspect of his course is that he would ask us to participate in class and share our opinions about the reading but when we talked about our opinions he would criticize them so participation really went down at the end of the year. Also the reading questions due before class are super unhelpful since they are worth a decent portion of your grade and they are graded based on correctness. The problem is, they are done before class so there isn‚Äôt time to ask for help or let the material sink in. A decent amount of students were kinda stressed about the reading questions since some of the questions were cryptic and the readings were convoluted at times. I feel like the course causes more annoyance than stress but overall you are not missing out if you don‚Äôt take it. If you end up taking it I would recommend getting a different teacher to avoid boredom and annoyance. Might have been because I wasn‚Äôt really interested in what we were reading but the teacher didn‚Äôt help.",

This deeper analysis would have been helpful since there were numerous quiz questions that were either on material that wasn‚Äôt explicitly taught, or required analysis of what was taught, but then you were never taught how to do that analysis.

He challenges his students, which will definitely make yo+u a better learner, and he always makes sure to stay on a particular subject until the entire class understands it, not just the most advanced students. Also, he is willing to engage in discussions with students and gets super interested in what they have to say, even if it‚Äôs not entirely related to the subject of discussion (for example if you have an insight about the material and want to share it, many times it will turn into a class-wide discussion).

Dr. Neemeh was a great teacher though and helped me to understand the material. As long as you watch the lectures before class (very important to do!!) then the class will make sense. The course workload wasnt too much but for writing assignments definitely dont wait until last minute in case you need help on answering some of the questions (as Dr. Neemeh doesnt usually answer emails over weekends). He was helpful in office hours and lets you run ideas by him to let you know if you are on the right track. Also not a mean grader! As long as you put in the work and show an understanding of the material, its not hard to get an A (this is for things like the writing assignments). The exams in this class are a little challenging but as long as you understand the material you will be fine. The exams are open note so they wont ask simple definition questions and will require you to be well versed in the subject. But dont let that discourage you!!! Just make sure to always watch the lectures before class and if you are struggling with something then go to office hours. If you do this then you will be just fine. There were, at least this year, corrections for the exams that will give you up to half points back. Dr. Neemeh is a pretty fair and lenient grader on exams. Overall great teacher but MSB was not my favorite course. (Though not hard to finish with a strong A as long as you put in the work :))!",

As a teacher, Dr. Bischof is super nice and as said above, extremely lenient with extensions (no limit on extensions, as long as you ask about 24ish hours in advance, she‚Äôll give you one without needing justification). She always gives super detailed feedback on papers, explaining exactly which parts were good and what you could add to make it better for next time. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say she‚Äôs a ‚Äúlenient‚Äù grader but definitely super fair and if you go to her Office Hours your essay grade will literally increase by like 5-10%. Also pro tip: for the expert sessions, assume no one has done the reading and ask questions that are good but can still be answered without reading the text. I feel like that usually generates more participation from the class. And one last thing, make sure to email her the expert session slides 24 hrs in advance.

Grading is completely fair and nothing to really worry about. If you put in the effort, you‚Äôll do very well. Dr. Drogalis allows extensions on all assignments so long as they‚Äôre requested at least 24 hours beforehand, and that‚Äôs been helpful to me a few times over the year. Papers are difficult enough to be a challenge without ever seeming overwhelming or impossible. Dr. Drogalis is also very willing to talk through things and give you feedback about paper ideas in Office Hours, so I‚Äôd highly recommend going to those. Overall, I really cannot say enough good things about Dr. Drogalis and her class. I‚Äôd highly recommend taking DFRL with her!",

Also, she basically reads everything in class with everyone (we each were one character when reading Hamlet for example, best part of the class), so just skim the readings. But read them for the first few weeks because she doesn‚Äôt always do that in the fall semester. She‚Äôs a harsh grader, on the homework assignments I usually got 8.5/10, maybe 9/10 on a good week and 7/10 on a bad. She gave a lot of good feedback on all the homework and the bigger assignments. On the bigger papers I got a few B+ and some B‚Äôs. I probably spent about 4-5 hrs a week (not including class time) on this class at the beginning (like when I did all the readings and stuff) but once I figured out how much she reviews the text in class I was only spending like 3-4hrs.

My English writing skills dramatically improved at the end of the school year (some in the Chinese OHS circle say that JE001 makes you good enough for college, and I think there is some truth to that), so I‚Äôd say it's a win. Overall just prepare for some low scores in the beginning and don‚Äôt panic when you do, note down what went wrong and try again next time. Middle school English is definitely going to be different from elementary school so don‚Äôt take it personally. Other than that, visit the writing center often and make it a habit, especially for those of you (like me) who have a hard time getting to office hours due to time zones and b&m school.

      "text": "Don‚Äôt do it. Seriously, it‚Äôs not a good idea. Mrs. Stanford is very passionate about the material she teaches, but she‚Äôs often very focused on her own ideas and snaps at anyone who has different thoughts. She makes a big point about textual evidence in class even when discussing the wider ideas and meaning behind Shakesphere‚Äôs writing, even when we‚Äôre diving into the realm of ‚Äúwell maybe shakespeare meant this‚Äù she‚Äôll only agree with the ideas without textual evidence IF she likes them. My second point ( this is going to be a better essay than I‚Äôve ever written in class for some reason /(h)j ) is her tech issues. Not her own tech issues, mind you. Tech issues should never be something to be angry at someone, and Mrs. Stanford has a lot of them, which is not the problem. The problem is that Mrs. Stanford literally attacks kids who have internet issues, giving them lower participation grades and just treating them unfairly, when she herself spends a good twenty minutes out of some classes out of the room. Now, to quote her many times, ‚ÄúPlease fix this before you come to class with tech support‚Äù (Stanford, 167). I‚Äôm sorry but a lot of people don‚Äôt have fast internet and they can‚Äôt fix it, and even if they could you can‚Äôt predict tech issues before they happen. Next on my long list of issues with this class is the grading. Not only is she crazy biased in her grading, but it takes so long. I understand that she‚Äôs busy and she has other matters to attend to, but it's seriously hard to have a single day to correct my draft and address all her feedback. Once I had to literally rewrite a paper because of how much she wanted me to change. I understand that my paper needs correcting, but I can‚Äôt do my best work in a day. Either push the date back or give feedback earlier so we can go to the writing and tutoring center.",

She also stresses participation a lot so i would recommend you participate A LOT in the beginning of the year to make a good impression. However, her feedback is incredibly detailed and she genuinely wants you to improve. Also second semester Hamlet was amazing so definitely recommend",

      "text": "(Dr. KLAH) Dr. KLAH is a W. I loved her class. This is a wonderful course if you want to improve upon your writing skills and understanding of complex classic texts. Discussion sections are always lively and often take us to very interesting places. Dr. KLAH‚Äôs affinity for the little details (multiple definitions of words, rhyme scheme, etc.) make for some hilarious and productive conversations. (You can tell Dr. KLAH really loves literature because of the way she approaches the readings). The prompts she uses at the start of class are always unique and help me understand the text better. She encourages many different interpretations, especially in the weekly writing practices. In my opinion, the writing practices are super helpful to build up the skills (textual analysis, how to write a paragraph, how to make a good claim, etc.) that will be expected on the WAs. It's relatively easy to get good grades on the homework, as long as you try to come up with something insightful/interesting to write about. She‚Äôs definitely a tougher grader on WAs (I consistently got high 80s), but offers a lot of quality feedback. However, getting a good participation score is easy as long as you contribute on mic once or twice per class and volunteer to read slides. As far as grading speed goes, she is definitely slow (in my experience, it takes about 2 weeks to get homework back and about 3-4 weeks to get a WA back), but the comments are worth it. Every one of her suggestions is specific and relevant. In my opinion, Dr. KLAH is really awesome about offering support outside of class. She always lets us know when the WTC is hosting a helpful event, encourages us to attend office hours, and answers emails super fast. I would definitely recommend using the course lab/office hours for big assignments (like the WAs), it helps a lot. Overall this class is a blast and Dr. KLAH is a wonderful teacher. 10/10, would recommend to all literature nerd middle schoolers.",

      "text": "(Dr. Hendrickson) I really enjoyed this class! Dr. Hendrickson made it engaging and as mentioned above the discussions were really fun. Always gave 10/10 on weekly homeworks, (didn‚Äôt give any feedback on the weekly homeworks at all though) as long as you did the minimum required work, basically just writing a paragraph that answers the prompt. I personally got an average of 89 on the bigger papers (he gave good feedback on these). Each week you have to do two readings (one for each class), usually ~5 pages, not that long, and one (or at the end of the spring semester) two paragraphs for a homework assignment. I spent about 3-4 hrs total in the week (on a week without a big paper due) in this class so it was very manageable (in my opinion). Dr. Hendrickson always had time for ‚ÄúBurning Questions‚Äù so make sure to note down all your questions. Favorite part of class was probably the literary warm-ups and maybe the 30sec stretch breaks. Overall, a great class, highly recommended!",
